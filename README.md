# linearalgebra

Files Included:

vector.py - contains the class and functions that provide the 
key functionality of the library

vector_input.py - contains the class and functions that are 
used by vector.py

test_functions.py - contains the tests for the functions in
vector.py

This library is a starting point for other programs that expand 
on the functionality of this one. The library can be further 
optimized by shortening the length of the functions because 
some code such as the code for taking the input is redundant.

Also, as you can see the README.md file isn't complete. It's 
missing the table of contents, installation instructions, 
usage instructions, etc. The README.md will be updated to 
include more things, and the functions in the vector class will
be shortened. More functions may or may not be added and 
full coverage for the tests may not be achieved. I have 
identified a bug where if anything except a number is passed 
as input, the program throws an exception instead of printing 
and error statement. 

Also, I am aware that numpy has similar functions to some that
I have made. I started this without knowing that but continued
after finding out just to practice my programming.
